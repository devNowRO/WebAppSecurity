For more details on this issue refer <span class='icb'>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection</span><br><br></div>
<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>3xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>3xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>3xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses.

IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>5-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>6-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>4-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>4-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>4</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>5-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>6-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>4-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>4-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>4</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>' and sleep(5)#</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small snippet of SQL code that will cause the database server to sleep for <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds. If this code is executed then the application will return the response <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>2xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>2xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>4-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>6-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>7-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>5-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>5-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>5</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>6-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>7-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>5-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>5-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>5</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>4-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>2xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>2xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>4xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>4xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>4xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>4xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>

IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>4-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>6-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>7-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>5-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>5-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>5</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>5' and 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5' and 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>5' and 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>5' and 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>AND</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
