<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>'</span> as payload to the application and the response that came back had the error message <span class='hlg'>You have an error in your SQL syntax;</span>. This error message is usually associated with SQL query related errors and it appears that the payload was able to break out of the data context and cause this error. This is an indication of SQL Injection.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the response received for the payload and confirm if the error message actually is because of some SQL related exception on the server-side. Try sending the same request without the payload and check if the error goes away.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>. Your feedback will help improve the accuracy of the scanner.

Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses.

Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>1xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>1xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>1xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.
