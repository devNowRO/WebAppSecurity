<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 3:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>' or sleep(5)#</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small snippet of SQL code that will cause the database server to sleep for <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds. If this code is executed then the application will return the response <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>5007</span> milliseconds.

To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of seconds of delay to different values.

<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 3:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>ccxxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>ccxxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>ccxxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>ccxxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>qqqqxxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>qqqqxxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>qqqqxxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>qqqqxxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 3:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>ccxxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>ccxxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>ccxxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>ccxxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>' or sleep(5)='</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small snippet of SQL code that will cause the database server to sleep for <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds. If this code is executed then the application will return the response <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>5055</span> milliseconds.

<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 3:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>ddxxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>ddxxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>ddxxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>ddxxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>bbxxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>bbxxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bbxxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bbxxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>rrrrxxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>rrrrxxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>rrrrxxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>rrrrxxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 3:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>ttttxxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>ttttxxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>ttttxxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>ttttxxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>' or sleep(5)='</span> as payload to the application.

<div class='desc'><div class='desc_title'>Description:</div>Command Injection was identified in the <span class='ico'><b>govtissuedid</b></span> parameter of the <span class='ico'><b>Body</b></span> section of the scanned request.<br><br>Command Injection is an issue where it is possible to inject and execute operating system commands on the server-side. For more details on this issue refer <span class='icb'>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection</span><br><br></div>
<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>&amp;&amp; ping -c 6 localhost</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small system command - <span class='hlg'>ping -c 6 localhost</span>. If this command is executed then the server will ping itself <span class='hlg'>6</span> times. This will cause the response to be returned around <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>10079</span> milliseconds. Normally this particular request is processed at around <span class='hlg'>49</span> milliseconds. This indicates that the injected command could have been executed on the server-side.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of ping requests sent to different values. Then you can observe if the time taken for the response to be returned is affected accordingly.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>. Your feedback will help improve the accuracy of the scanner.
