IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>z'||'zzzz</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>z'+'zzzz</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>z' 'zzzz</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload B and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads A. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span> database server Payloads B &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload A would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>z'||'zzzz</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>z'+'zzzz</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>z' 'zzzz</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload B and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads A. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span> database server Payloads B &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload A would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>v'||'vvvv</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>v'+'vvvv</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>v' 'vvvv</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload B and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads A. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span> database server Payloads B &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload A would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>e'||'e</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>e'+'e</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>e' 'e</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload B and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads A. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span> database server Payloads B &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload A would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.
