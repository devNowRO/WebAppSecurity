IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>5xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>' or sleep(5)='</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small snippet of SQL code that will cause the database server to sleep for <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds.

After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>423166</span> milliseconds.

To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of seconds of delay to different values.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>3xxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>3xxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3xxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>3xxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>localhost:65555</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>localhost:65533</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>localhost:66666</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>localhost:65534</span><br><br>Payloads A and C are similar in nature. They both refer to ports 65555 and 66666 on the server which are invalid ports.<br>Payloads B and D are similar to each other but different from A &amp; C. They both refer to ports 65533 and 65534 on the server which are valid ports.<br>If the application is vulnerable to SSRF then it will try to connect to these ports and connections to invalid ports with throw an exception of different type than the exception or error caused by connecting to the valid ports 65533 and 65534 which are most likely to be closed.<br>This would mean that the response for Payloads A &amp; C must be similar to each other and different from responses for Payloads B&amp;D. <br><br>The responses for the injected payloads were analyzed and it was found that Payloads A &amp; C got a similar looking response and were also different from responses got from Payloads B &amp; D, thereby indicating the presence of this vulnerability.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can first manually look at the responses received for Payloads A, B, C and D. Analyze these payloads and verify if indeed A &amp; C got similar responses and were different from B &amp; D. You can also change the payloads for A &amp; C by chaning the port number to some other invalid port and change payloads B &amp; D to some other valid port numbers and check of the four response show the same pattern as before.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>. Your feedback will help improve the accuracy of the scanner.
