IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>aa/../items</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>aa../items</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bb/../items</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bb../items</span><br><br>Payloads A and C are similar in nature. They both refer to the file <span class='hlg'>items</span> by including an imaginary directory in the path (aa &amp; bb) but then also invalidating it by traversing upwards by one directory using <span class='hlg'>../</span>. So these payloads must have the same effect as referring to the file <span class='hlg'>items</span> normally.<br>Payloads B and D are similar to each other but different from A &amp; C. They refer to the file <span class='hlg'>items</span> inside invalid directories (aa &amp; bb).<br>If the application is vulnerable to Local File Include then the response for Payloads A &amp; C must be similar to each other and different from responses for Payloads B&amp;D. The responses for the injected payloads were analyzed and it was found that Payloads A &amp; C got a similar looking response and were also different from responses got from Payloads B &amp; D, thereby indicating the presence of this vulnerability.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can first manually look at the responses received for Payloads A, B, C and D. Analyze these payloads and verify if indeed A &amp; C got similar responses and were different from B &amp; D. You can also change the payloads for A &amp; C by adding one more invalid directory and one more <span class='hlg'>../</span> to invalidate that directory. This must get the same response as the responses for A &amp; C.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

</div>
</div>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 2:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>1' and 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1' and 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>1' and 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>1' and 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>AND</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.
