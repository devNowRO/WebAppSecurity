<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>3-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>4-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>2-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>2-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>2</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>. Your feedback will help improve the accuracy of the scanner.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>4-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A, B, C and D are similar to each other and is different from Payloads E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A, B, C and D. Since in all four cases the substration is a valid SQL syntax their responses are similar. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts so their responses are different. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payloads should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>4-1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>5-2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>11-5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>12-6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3-a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3-b</span><br>Payload A and B is the subtraction of two numbers whose difference is <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A, B, C and D are similar to each other and is different from Payloads E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A, B, C and D. Since in all four cases the substration is a valid SQL syntax their responses are similar. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts so their responses are different. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payloads should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
