You can also change the payloads for A &amp; C by adding one more invalid directory and one more <span class='hlg'>../</span> to invalidate that directory.

Payload C and D is also the subtraction of two numbers whose difference would be <span class='hlg'>6</span>. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts as a string is being deducted from a number.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the subtraction of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since their differnce is the same their responses are similar. Payloads C and D have a different difference values. Payload E and F are invalid subtraction attempts. If the application was not actually performing subtraction then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
